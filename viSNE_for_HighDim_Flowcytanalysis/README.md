# viSNE_for_HighDim_Flowcytanalysis
 Functions to handle Flowcytometrydata, create viSNE maps and implement labeled datasets for supervised machinelearning

# Usage skripts

Different usage skripts are present illustrating examples, however the main library is the ML_tsne_lib file from which functions can be imported.
Use:

import sys
sys.path.append(r"mypath")

at the top of the skript to allow import from ML_tsne_lib. This is because this modules are not setup properly as a package.
